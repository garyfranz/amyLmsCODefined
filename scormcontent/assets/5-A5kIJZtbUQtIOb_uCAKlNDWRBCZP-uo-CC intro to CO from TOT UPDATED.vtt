Each and every day, all over the world, life changing journeys begin.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.480
In classrooms and school yards, refugees preparing for resettlement gather

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.220
together with books and children, curiosity and questions.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.480
They come on foot or by bus to an unfamiliar place to learn

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.020
about an unfamiliar land, the United States. During the next few days,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.640
the understanding of their new home will increase exponentially.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.620
This is where it starts. Are you ready? This is cultural orientation.
