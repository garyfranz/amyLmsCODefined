00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.059
The Cultural Orientation Objectives and Indicators

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.942
There's so much that refugees need to learn 
about life in the U.S.

3
00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:10.057
Where do we start?

4
00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:18.074
Cultural Orientation, often called CO, is an education 
program where refugees get information

5
00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:23.097
on how to adapt to their new lives and achieve 
self-sufficiency in the U.S.

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.680
CO takes place overseas and domestically.

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.733
The Cultural Orientation Objectives and Indicators, 
also called the CO O&Is, help us prioritize what to teach.

8
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.764
They clearly outline what a refugee is expected to learn

9
00:00:39.764 --> 00:00:43.694
and be able to do by the end of Cultural Orientation.

10
00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:48.232
Both overseas and domestic CO repeat and build on the same topics

11
00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:54.172
which creates consistent messaging 
for refugees throughout the resettlement process.

12
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.287
This is known as the CO Continuum.

13
00:00:57.287 --> 00:01:03.758
This consistent messaging improves refugees' abilities 
to recall the information learned

14
00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:09.000
and ultimately improves their ability to navigate life in the U.S.

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
