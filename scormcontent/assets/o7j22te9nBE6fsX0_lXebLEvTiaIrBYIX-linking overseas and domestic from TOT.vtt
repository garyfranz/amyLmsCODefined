00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.060
Okay, we're gonna play a small game and then we're gonna talk about

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.380
the specifics of each program. Okay, so we're gonna make

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.620
a small circle. Oftentimes, a good activity will link overseas and domestic

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.120
CO training. A lot of overseas CO is kind of lost somewhere in

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.540
the ocean, but if you bring in a similar activity that they did

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.500
during overseas CO, then they can remember the messages

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.860
that were given and say, "Oh, yes, I remember this." And it can

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.000
really reinforce those things that were taught overseas and need to be reinforced domestically.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.440
Okay, so I'm going to play some music. When I hit play,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.040
I would like you to walk or dance this away.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.820
A good example from our class is the musical chairs game.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.460
The game is still really revitalizing. It brings life to the classroom.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:14.660
Hopefully they've heard these messages before. The lesson behind musical

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.060
chairs is that we compare it to the US job market,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.670
so musical chairs and the US job market are competitive, they involve luck.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.080
If you don't get the chair the first time, then you have to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.440
try again, you know? And the comparisons can keep going. 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.240
Okay, two more chairs out. If you only have one person working,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.400
then everybody has to essentially fit in the chair with you,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.560
and so you might have to have two or three people working from

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.260
the same family.
